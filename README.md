# Stroke_Prediction
## Stroke Prediction model using PCA.
### We build different classification models to predict if the patient will have a Stroke based on other health features.
### We will use PCA (Principal component analysis) to reduce dimensionality of data and observe the impact on accuracy of different models we have build over the provided data.

## Libraries used:
    numpy
    pandas
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    missingno
    sklearn
## Data Reading
    Training data matrix: (43400, 12)
    Test data matrix: (18601, 11)

## Data Cleaning
    Removal of 'na' or missing values
